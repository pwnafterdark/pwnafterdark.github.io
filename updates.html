I've spent a few more hours looking into 'todo'. Theoretically, I have a 15 byte OOB write into a calloc'd buffer, but only the last 7 of those bytes can corrupt the meta-data of the next chunk. The binary also has full relro protections, so I'm not sure how to exploit it? There are house techniques that can get me a WRITE-WHAT-WHERE primitive (I think), but then what?
</p>

<p>
I've found <a href="https://nguendung.github.io/posts/otw-protections-and-bypass-101/">this</a> cool website by SuiiKawaii, who suggests using,
<ul>
        <li>.fini_array/.init_array (if writable in the target, not always).</li>
        <li>Function pointers / vtables / callback tables in .data/heap.</li>
        <li>ret2dlresolve: forge relocation and let the dynamic loader resolve system.</li>
</ul>

But I'll have to keep researching more into these techniques. Hopefully there's something easier...

I've skimmed to chapter 5 in 'Verilog HDL', and it's not too bad! I think it'll take some time to get over just writing test-cases, and not having the GUI that something like Digital provides. That's OK, I'm an adult now. Anyways, I've 'made' my first SR-latch (I didn't really make it, the book just gives the code),

<pre>
<code>
/* SR latch */
module SR_latch(Q, Qbar, Sbar, Rbar);

output Q, Qbar;
input Sbar, Rbar;

nand n1(Q, Sbar, Qbar);
nand n2(Qbar, Rbar, Q);

endmodule

/* stimulus */
module Top;

wire q, qbar;
reg set, reset;

SR_latch m1(q, qbar, ~set, ~reset);

initial
begin
        $monitor($time, " set = %b, reset = %b, q = %b, qbar = %b\n", set, reset, q, qbar);
        set = 0;
        reset = 0;
        #5 reset = 1;
        #5 reset = 0;
        #5 set = 1;
end

endmodule
</code>
</pre>

Cool, I think I should be ready to start making all of the basic components for a CPU. Just off the top of my head,
<ul>
        <li>multiplexers</li>
        <li>latches (going until D-flipflop with enable bit)</li>
        <li>registers</li>
        <li>adders</li>
</ul>

And so on.

Sheesh! "The Art of Electronics" is a massive book. Normally, I wouldn't read something like this so rigourously. I'd just skim some chapters then give myself a project to work on. I don't know how to do that for electronics, but I'll have to figure something out. I mean, reading isn't bad per-say, it's just starting to feel a bit bookish :(. But, I did learn about Thevenin equivalent circuits :D

It turns out I'm dumber than I thought I was. After reading <em>just the first line</em> of <a href="robbert1978.github.io/2025/03/28/2025-3-29-CodeGate-2025-Quals/index.html">this</a> solution to the 'todo' CTF challenge, it's so obvious that file-parsing logic can be broken by embedding tokens into your note. Anyways, if you put a <code>||</code> in the title of your node, then you have an OOB write in the description buffer. Maybe there's a stronger primitive... I don't know since I literally just read the first line of the solution.
</p>

To take my mind off what a spectacular failure that was, I've found a book called 'Verilog HDL' by Samir Palnitkar. Hopefully learning out of this book will teach me the basics of Verilog, and then I can give myself a project to work on. I was thinking of starting simple, and just making a MIPS processor, since 'Computer Architecture and Design' essentially spoon-feeds the design to you.
</p>

<p>
Yes, yes I'll starting going through 'The Art of Electronics'. I've had a busy few weeks, with some mid-sized moments in my live. Time to lock in.

I've spent a few hours looking at the todo challenge, but I can't seem to make any progress on the challenge.
There's a 'vulnerability' (it's really just bad coding practice) where users can keep creating notes in the same index, which is a memory leak.
There does't seem to be any UAFs, or OOBs, so I'm mostly focusing on the arb file read/write, which can be exploited by writing to the note at index 8.
The flag can be loaded into an automatic buffer, but file parsing code prevents it from being stored in static or heap memory.
I'll keep persisting with this challenge, and if you have any hints, please do email me :D

I've been looking to get into Verilog so I can start programatically designing ciruits.
I know Cadence has resource for starting out, so I'll give those a shot.
Surely there's some good textbooks for me to learn from too, but I really need to get my hands on a Raspberry Pi or something so I can start revising my embedded programming skills.
</p>

<p>
I haven't made much progress on 'The Art of Electronics', because this CTF problem has consumed me. So much so that I end up working until midnight, leaving no time for the gym (or dinner).
Anyways, I've seen some discussion on Twitter about using XOR or MOV instructions to exchange two variables. I've done some rudimentary experiments, and MOV seems to be the clear winner. I'll have to investigate this further, but it's something I've pushed onto the back-burner
